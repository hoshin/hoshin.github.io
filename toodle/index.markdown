# What's [Toodle](http://www.toodle.it)?

Toodle is a project I've been working on for the past couple of years. Although it's mainly a laboratory for me, 
it's also a live tournament management application that aims to remove all the clutter possible so that you can start
pretty much right away (most of the system does not require any kind of registration right now, to try and streamline
the creation & tournament enrollment process).


# How is that some sort of lab?
Toodle got me pretty much started with NodeJS, Angular, D3.JS, using sprites (and web browser optimizations in general) 
and AWS deployment and I try and add new topics (provided they're relevant) as often as I can.
